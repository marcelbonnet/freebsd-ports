Ardour BSD aims to be the last possible portable and maintainable
port of the latest Ardour releases due to changes to the upstream
release cycle and the fact that the audio/ardour port (version 2)
should not be removed, since it stil quite stable and usefull as
a lite DAW, though with less features, compared to the new releases.

Ardour BSD is a fork from Ardour, a digital audio workstation.

You can use it to record, edit, and mix multi-track audio and MIDI.
Produce your own CD's.  Mix video soundtracks. Experiment with new ideas
about music and sound.

Ardour BSD capabilities include: multichannel recording, non-linear, non-
destructive region based editing with unlimited undo/redo, full automation
support, a mixer whose capabilities rival high end hardware consoles, lots
of plugins to warp, shift, and shape your music, and controllable from
hardware control surfaces at the same time as it syncs to timecode.  If you
have been looking for a tool similar to ProTools, Nuendo, Cubase SX, Digital
Performer, Samplitude, or Sequoia, you might have found it.

Ardour BSD does not conflicts with former Ardour 2.x, and both can be
installed together.
